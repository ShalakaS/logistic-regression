    "\n",
    "The titanic dataset is a popular dummy dataset used to learn about logistic regression. It has also been used in a [Kaggle data science competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), so you'll also find blogposts exploring all kinds of more advanced concepts that use this dataset too! In this assignment, you'll do a logistic regression to look at the effect of sex and class on survival on the titanic, by computing odds ratios.\n",
